<h2> What is gravity? </h2>
<p> 
&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; Gravity, or gravitation, is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass are brought toward (or gravitate toward) one another, 
including objects ranging from atoms and photons, to planets and stars. Since energy and mass are equivalent, 
all forms of energy (including light) cause gravitation and are under the influence of it. 
On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects, and the Moon's gravity causes the ocean tides. 
The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing, 
forming stars – and for the stars to group together into galaxies – so gravity is responsible for many of the large scale structures in the Universe. 
Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become increasingly weaker on farther objects.

<h2> Double Slit Experiment </h2>
<p>
If light consisted strictly of ordinary or classical particles, 
and these particles were fired in a straight line through a slit and allowed to strike a screen on the other side,
we would expect to see a pattern corresponding to the size and shape of the slit. 
However, when this "single-slit experiment" is actually performed, 
the pattern on the screen is a diffraction pattern in which the light is spread out. 
The smaller the slit, the greater the angle of spread. The top portion of the image shows the central portion of the pattern formed
when a red laser illuminates a slit and, if one looks carefully, two faint side bands. More bands can be seen with a more highly refined apparatus. 
Diffraction explains the pattern as being the result of the interference of light waves from the slit.
